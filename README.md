# LethalCompanySaveManager
A quick and easy save manager for the game Lethal Company
# How to use
1. Download from source and compile your own .exe with visual studio
2. OR download the release version and it should just work
3. Choose save 1-3 and back them up or delete them
4. Manage up to 20 backups by default.

# Additional Notes
I plan on adding more information to the selected save on the main screen in the future.
