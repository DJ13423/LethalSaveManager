# LethalCompanySaveManager
A quick and easy save manager for the game Lethal Company
# How to use
1. Download from source and compile your own .exe with visual studio
2. OR download the release version and it should just work
3. Choose save 1-3 and back them up or delete them
4. Manage up to 20 backups by default.

# Additional Notes
I looked to see if I could get any more information from the saves so they could be distinguished within the file manager, but didn't see an easy way to do this. I believe the developer does not want us accessing the info in the save games to avoid save game editing, so I will leave it alone for now.
